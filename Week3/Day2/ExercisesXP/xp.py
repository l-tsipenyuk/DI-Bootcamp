# Exercise 1 : Pets
# Instructions
# Using this code:

# class Pets():
#     def __init__(self, animals):
#         self.animals = animals

#     def walk(self):
#         for animal in self.animals:
#             print(animal.walk())

# class Cat():
#     is_lazy = True

#     def __init__(self, name, age):
#         self.name = name
#         self.age = age

#     def walk(self):
#         return f'{self.name} is just walking around'

# class Bengal(Cat):
#     def sing(self, sounds):
#         return f'{sounds}'

# class Chartreux(Cat):
#     def sing(self, sounds):
#         return f'{sounds}'


# Create another cat breed named Siamese which inherits from the Cat class.
# Create a list called all_cats, which holds three cat instances : one Bengal, one Chartreux and one Siamese.
# Those three cats are Sara’s pets. Create a variable called sara_pets which value is an instance of the Pet class, and pass the variable all_cats to the new instance.
# Take all the cats for a walk, use the walk method.

# class Pets():
#     def __init__(self, animals):
#         self.animals = animals

#     def walk(self):
#         for animal in self.animals:
#             print(animal.walk())

# class Cat():
#     is_lazy = True

#     def __init__(self, name, age):
#         self.name = name
#         self.age = age

#     def walk(self):
#         return f'{self.name} is just walking around'

# class Bengal(Cat):
#     def sing(self, sounds):
#         return f'{sounds}'

# class Chartreux(Cat):
#     def sing(self, sounds):
#         return f'{sounds}'

# class Siamese(Cat):
#     pass

# bengal = Bengal("Bengal",1)
# charteux = Chartreux("Chartreux",2)
# siamese = Siamese("Siamese",2)

# all_cats = [bengal,charteux,siamese]
# sara_pets = Pets(all_cats)
# sara_pets.walk()

# Exercise 2 : Dogs
# Instructions
# Create a class called Dog with the following attributes name, age, weight.
# Implement the following methods in the Dog class:
# bark: returns a string which states: “<dog_name> is barking”.
# run_speed: returns the dogs running speed (weight/age*10).
# fight : takes a parameter which value is another Dog instance, called other_dog. This method returns a string stating which dog won the fight. The winner should be the dog with the higher run_speed x weight.

# Create 3 dogs and run them through your class.

class Dog:
    def __init__(self,name,age,weight):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.weight = weight
    def bark(self):
        return f"{self.name} is barking."
    def run_speed(self):
        speed = self.weight/self.age*10
        return f"{self.name}'s running speed is {speed} km per hour"
    def fight(self,other_dog):
        if self.run_speed() * self.weight > other_dog.run_speed() * other_dog.weight:
            return f"{self.name} won."
        else:
            return f"{other_dog.name} won."

# dog1 = Dog("Rex",5,50)
# dog2 = Dog("Sparky",3,27)
# dog3 = Dog("Whiskey",10,20)
# print(dog1.bark())
# print(dog1.run_speed())
# print(dog1.fight(dog2))

# Exercise 3 : Dogs Domesticated
# Instructions
# Create a new python file and import your Dog class from the previous exercise.
# In the new python file, create a class named PetDog that inherits from Dog.
# Add an attribute called trained to the __init__ method, this attribute is a boolean and the value should be False by default.
# Add the following methods:
# train: prints the output of bark and switches the trained boolean to True

# play: takes a parameter which value is a few names of other Dog instances (use *args). The method should print the following string: “dog_names all play together”.

# do_a_trick: If the dog is trained the method should print one of the following sentences at random:
# “dog_name does a barrel roll”.
# “dog_name stands on his back legs”.
# “dog_name shakes your hand”.
# “dog_name plays dead”.

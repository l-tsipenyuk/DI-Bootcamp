**Project Title:** Energy Generation Tracker

**Project Description:**
Python-based command-line tool that allows users to track and analyze energy generation data from an open database. The tool should use Object-Oriented Programming principles to structure the code effectively and implement the following features:

1. **Data Retrieval:** Download and work with data from Excel database.
Data Source: https://www.energyinst.org/statistical-review/resources-and-data-downloads

2. **Data Analysis:** There are various functionalities to analyze the electricity generation data by country. Users can input specific queries:

   - User inputs a country and receives historical energy production data categorized by source from the oldest available date to the most recent.
   - Users can save the fetched data for a specific country in a PostgreSQL database (options available: create a table, fill in the data and delete the table in the database).
   - Users can query a country, year and get the electricity generation mix in percentage.

   - User inputs a country, a year, a generation source, and selects "peers," resulting in the identification of five countries closest in generation source share to the desired country for the specified year.

   - User inputs a country and selects "renewables," yielding three rows of data showcasing the year-over-year change in renewable energy generation (in %) within the country, its region, and globally.
 


3. **User Interaction:** There will be a user-friendly command-line interface that allows users to input commands and queries.

4. **Data Export:** There will be an option for users to export analysis results and visualizations to JSON files or other formats (Excel or SQL database?..)

5. **Faker Integration:** There could be an option to compare renewables generation data with the "plan" generated by faker (or any other implication of faker). 


The project will contribute to environmental awareness by providing a tool for analyzing shift towards energy transition in different countries from 1985 to 2022. Users can gain insights into energy generation patterns and potentially maore effectively analyze countries' renewable energy policies.

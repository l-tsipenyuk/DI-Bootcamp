I'm working on creating an Anki web application that aims to provide an engaging and interactive learning experience. Here's a refined and more detailed description of the project:

Project Overview: Anki Web Application

Features:

Card Creation:

Users can create cards containing a word, its meaning, and an associated image.
Option to insert a URL for the image or search for an image using a word through Giphy integration.
Card Storage:

Cards will be saved on the server or in a database for persistent storage.
Memory Game:

Users can play a memory game with the created cards.
Game mode involves matching words with corresponding images or typing the word based on an image.
A scoring system is implemented to track user performance during the game.
Display All Cards:

View and review all created cards in a user-friendly interface.
Search Functionality:

Search for a specific card by typing its name or relevant details.
Score Tracking:

A scoring mechanism throughout the application to encourage user engagement.
Display the total score after completing the memory game.
Provide the maximum achievable score for comparison.
Implementation Steps:

Frontend Development:

Create a user-friendly interface for card creation, memory game, and card display.
Implement forms for inputting words, meanings, and images.
Include options for Giphy integration and image URL insertion.
Backend Development:

Set up a server or choose a suitable backend framework.
Implement API endpoints for card creation, retrieval, and storage.
Integrate a database to persistently store user-created cards.
Memory Game Logic:
